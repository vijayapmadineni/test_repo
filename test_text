Last year you helped us to onboard our cicd pipelines to snow. At that time you identified the pipeline cde-glue-integration already exist(on boarded?)
We havenâ€™t used this pipeline as of now for auto deployments through snow.
We will start using this pipeline and we are testing this and noticed that this pipeline is not working in integration with snow.
In SNOW Version displays as No matches found.
Can you please help us to fix the issue to onboard pipeline to snow.
I opened ticket for this: xxxx
