This year, I successfully fulfilled my core job responsibilities while contributing to team success and aligning my efforts with Healthfirst's strategic priorities. Below is a summary of my accomplishments and how they reflect the Trailblazer culture:

Contributing to Team Success:
Led the migration of over 200+ AWS Glue jobs to version 4, enabling improved performance, reduced runtime, and adoption of the latest functionalities. This initiative significantly streamlined operations and enhanced job reliability.
Provided guidance to the CJA team, empowering them to learn AWS Glue, adopt best practices, and helped with deployment processes. This fostered cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Introduced a custom scheduler for AWS Glue jobs, delivering flexibility for scheduling jobs on demand. This eliminated dependency on production deployments for custom on demand schedules.

Impact on Healthfirst's Strategic Priorities:
Delivered impactful solutions for the Formulary Project, utilizing OpenSearch technology and integrating data pipelines with Open FDA, PostgreSQL, and OpenSearch within a short timeframe. These efforts aligned with Healthfirst's focus on innovation and operational excellence.
Enhanced the efficiency of Twilio-related jobs by implementing a performance optimization solution. This reduced processing time, enabled near real-time data insights, and supported timely decision-making for critical operations.
Delivered complex Provider and Pharmacy Fax workflows, ensuring efficient integration of external SFTP files with Alfresco and Kitewheel systems.

Trailblazer Culture and Compliance Standards:
Demonstrated innovation by improving coding standards through enhanced logging, scheduling, and naming conventions. Additionally, I developed a Lambda function for reporting job failures and logging statuses, driving process transparency and reliability.
Fostered collaboration by integrating data pipelines with ServiceNow self-service deployments, empowering teams to deploy code independently and efficiently.
Took ownership of production jobs, monitoring their performance, resolving failures, and ensuring smooth monthly production releases.

Impact on Members, Providers, and Sponsors:
Enabled more efficient data delivery and availability, such as with the preference management and DNC file changes, which directly support member engagement and compliance.
Continue support of mm project which directly impacts pharamcy and member engagements.
Delivered reliable solutions for data processing and integration, enhancing provider and sponsor interactions through timely and accurate information delivery.

Demonstrate our compliance standards:
Consistently monitored production jobs to identify and mitigate risks, ensuring alignment with compliance requirements.
Completed all compliance trainings on time, adhered to policies, and proactively raised and resolved issues to prevent non-compliance.
